Whenever we write form we always use form tag, form tag has a default behaviour it refreshes the page.
Form has its own event that is onSubmit.
Whenever someone will click on the button it will call event onSubmit of form. 
If we dont want this default behaviour of html form . whenever we call any function or event it will pass object, that object we can access , after accessing event obj there is a 
Method event.preventDefault() through which we can prevent this default behaviour
Now if i want to store what user has written than i use hooks for that.
In use state we can pass objects 
Here i passed fname and name
Whenever user type anything inputEvent will be called
